# Teensy3.1_Core

Examples of using the Teesny3.1's Freescale MK20DX256VMC7 microcontroller without using the TeensyDuino environment.

I like the Teensy3.1 as a dev board and wanted to learn more about configuring 32-bit microcontrollers from scratch. Thus this is a living project where I will attempt to add more and more examples of using the hardware peripherals on the Teensy (USB, I2c, SPI, UART, FTM, etc.) as I work it out.
